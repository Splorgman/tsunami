# What is this?

A tool for resident DJs of TheWaveVR, to simplify setting the offset on MP3 files, and to convert them to a fixed tempo if needed.

# How do I use it?

1. Download the most current release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Splorgman/tsunami/releases) link. Unzip it somewhere, and run *tsunami.exe*. 
2. Click `Set Output Directory` to select where to output the tempo converted and offset calculated MP3s to.
3. Input the new tempo that you want in the `BPM` field. If there are some MP3s that don't need tempo conversion, they will be copied to the new folder and have their offset calculated without any tempo conversion taking place.
4. Click `Convert`, sit back, and wait.

# This sucks or I want to tell you something about it sucks.

[Come say hi](https://discordapp.com/invite/thewavevr) on Discord. Or feel free to make a pull request. This is the first Electron app I've ever made, so it probably does suck. It is still a lot better than doing tempo conversion and offset calculation by hand though!
